                <p>Gateway Brewery is a casual restaurant that prides itself on using only the freshest ingredients as well as supporting local farmers by sourcing ingredients from the St. Louis area.</p>
				   <p>From the beginning, our founders wanted to foster a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere that included fresh and locally sourced ingredients to create a one-of-a-kind experience in the St. Louis area. Thanks to the support of family, friends, and others in the restaurant business, we have been able to make this dream come true.</p>
				   <p>We here at Gateway Brewery are blown away by the love and support that we have been shown and hope to serve you and St. Louis as a whole for years to come!</p>
